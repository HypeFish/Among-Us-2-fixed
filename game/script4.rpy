    "You remember that the alchemy club meets on tuesdays. She would have been in the building after Milicent left." 

    "You take the necklace out of your pocket. The L shines back at you. You don’t think you’ve ever seen Lavender wear a necklace like that, or has she? No she? She wouldn’t have done this."

    "The bell for first period rings, you’re out of time. You take the potion out of your pocket and down the last swallow."
